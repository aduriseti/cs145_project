MVP Problem: mood detection 

-Need to featurize tweets
-First solve the problem of classifying tweets as positive or negative

Tasks
-Analyze images 
-Pagerank for external links to determine reputable sources and then parse the page
-Make amount of shares/likes per tweet a feature
-Bag of words
-word2vec
-LSI
-LDA
-doc2vec

-Best way for featurizing words
-Best way for aggregating word vectors into document vectors
-Best hyperparameter sweep for training the model
